# being.toml: one config file per Being

Everything that differs between two Beings lives in one file in the Being's home: `being.toml`. Start from
[`templates/being.toml.example`](../templates/being.toml.example). It holds **no secrets** and is committed with the
Being's home; secrets live in the Being's key folder (`[being].config_dir`, 0700) or in each tool's own 0600 file.

Scripts read it with `scripts/being-config`:

```
scripts/being-config --file being.toml get tunnel.domain          # one value; lists print one item per line
scripts/being-config --file being.toml get box.ssh_port 22        # with a default
scripts/being-config --file being.toml access                     # the setup menu: every [access] key, on|off
scripts/being-config --file being.toml check                      # validate; exit 1 on errors
```

`{name}`, `{linux_user}`, `{config_dir}` and `{workspace}` in any string are filled from `[being]`. A leading `~/` is
expanded on the machine that reads the file (`--raw` keeps it, for paths meant for another machine).

## `[access]`: the setup menu

Every row is off unless switched on, except `owner_chat`, `claude` and `memory` (the Being cannot work without
them). `check` refuses unknown keys, non-boolean values, and `owner_chat = false`.

| Key | Tool | Login used | Risk |
|---|---|---|---|
| `owner_chat` | Teams chat with the owner (**required**) | Being | Low |
| `claude` | Claude Code sessions and jobs | Being's own seat | — |
| `memory` | Memory search (basic-memory) | Local | Low |
| `teammate_chats` | Teams chats with teammates (own chat only) | Being | Low |
| `group_chats` | Group chats and channels | Being | Medium |
| `being_mail` | The Being's own mail | Being | Medium |
| `being_onedrive` | The Being's own OneDrive (share by name) | Being | Medium |
| `presence` | Teams status and photo | Being | Low |
| `codex` | Codex (quick replies, fallback) | Being's own login | — |
| `owner_teams_read` | Owner's Teams, read only | Owner | Medium |
| `owner_teams_send` | Send as the owner after "send Dn" | Owner | High |
| `owner_mail_read` | Owner's mail, read only | Owner | Medium |
| `owner_mail_send` | Mail as the owner after "send Dn" | Owner | High |
| `owner_files` | Owner's OneDrive/SharePoint, read only | Owner browser | Medium |
| `owner_web` | Owner's Outlook/Teams web pages, read only | Owner browser | Medium |
| `shared_mailbox_read` | A shared mailbox, read replies | Owner | Medium |
| `shared_mailbox_send` | Shared mailbox drafts and reviewed batch send | Owner | High |
| `owner_channel_posts` | Channel posts as the owner (`detail.channels`) | Owner browser | High |
| `mail_rules` | Pre-approved forwarding rules (`detail.mail_rules`) | Owner | High |
| `area_approvers` | Per-area approvers (`detail.approvers`) | — | High |
| `github_being` | The Being's own GitHub account or a repo-limited token | Being | Medium |
| `github_owner` | The owner's GitHub login | Owner | Very high |
| `azure_devops` | Pipelines, work items | Being or owner | High |
| `cloud_cli` | Azure / Google Cloud CLI | Being or owner | Very high |
| `kubernetes` | Named clusters (`detail.clusters`) | Key | Very high |
| `notion` | One workspace (`detail.notion_workspace`) | Being integration | Medium |
| `tunnel` | Cloudflare tunnel for the Being's box | Admin key, setup only | Medium |
| `cloudflare_api` | Cloudflare API token on the Being's own box | Owner token | Very high |
| `app_keys` | Single-app keys (`detail.app_keys`, files in `config_dir`) | Key | Varies |
| `model_hubs` | Model hub keys | Key | Low |
| `model_proxy` | Local model proxy | Key | Low |
| `vpn` | VPN to private networks | Key | High |
| `device_sync` | Owner device sync | Owner's laptop | Medium |
| `desktop` | `<name>-desktop` on the owner's laptop | Owner's laptop | Low |

Owner rows (`owner_*`, `shared_mailbox_*`, `mail_rules`) need both the Being's and the owner's sessions in
`[sessions]`; `check` fails when one is on without an owner session.

## `[sessions]`: headless sign-ins

The Being works without a screen, so each login is made once and reused. **The Being and the owner each sign in
themselves, in separate sessions**, for Teams and for Outlook. Nothing is copied, merged or shared between them, or
between boxes.

| Key | Session | Who signs in | Default |
|---|---|---|---|
| `being_teams` | Being API session, Teams scopes | Owner or admin, once, device code, as the Being | `ops/teams-kit/state/token-cache.json` |
| `being_outlook` | Being API session, mail scopes | Same, as the Being (a separate sign-in with mail scopes; may share the Being's cache) | same file |
| `being_browser` | Being browser profile | The Being, once | `{config_dir}/being-browser` |
| `owner_teams` | Owner API session, Teams scopes | **The owner**, once, device code | `""` (off) |
| `owner_outlook` | Owner API session, mail scopes | **The owner**, once | `""` (off) |
| `owner_browser` | Owner browser profile | **The owner**, once | `""` (off) |

Rules: Being and owner paths never coincide (`check` fails); folders are 0700 and files 0600; every script asks
"who am I?" before acting and refuses a session that resolves to the wrong account; the owner's sessions stay empty
until an owner row in `[access]` is on. `skills/teams-kit/verify.sh` signs in silently to each of the four API
sessions and reports whose it is.

Teams kit `.env` keys for the same sessions: `BEING_CACHE` (Being Teams), `BEING_MAIL_CACHE` (Being Outlook, defaults
to `BEING_CACHE`), `OWNER_CACHE` (owner Teams), `OWNER_MAIL_CACHE` (owner Outlook, defaults to `OWNER_CACHE`),
`BEING_BROWSER_PROFILE`, `OWNER_BROWSER_PROFILE`.
